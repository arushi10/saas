# TPTs and TTs

## Week 0

### TPT 5.1

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
  Three beneficial effects of computing are it makes information more accessible, minimizes paper usage and is thus, more eco-friendly, and allows work to be distributed quicker and to a wider audience. Three harmful effects of computing are degradations in physical and mental health, increase in socio-economic divisions, and elimination of paper-based industries.   

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
  The dopamine rush that comes with certain digital applications can cause potential problems, especially if it makes the application addictive. Many students at Del Norte are addicted to gaming or social media because of this dopamine issue.
  
### TPT 5.2
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
  To empower themselves, someone can use digital platforms to share their thoughts and ideas. Additionally, they can digitally collaborate with a diverse range of people, which helps them become a global citizen.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
  Someone that is empowered can teach people who are not empowered how to use certain technologies, so they too can take advantage of them. Something I can do to digitally empower students at Del Norte is to organize workshops about CS topics.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
  Financial barriers sometimes prevent certain groups of people from accessing technology. One way we are overcoming these divides at Del Norte is by providing free Chromebooks to people who request them.
